# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-with-R
This repository consists of projects that I did while taking the Data Science and Machine Learning with R course on Udemy.

The projects are as follows:
1. Data Visualization for the economist magazine human development index vs corruption perceptions index data.

2. Money Ball Project: Description: The 2002 Oakland A's
The Oakland Athletics' 2002 season was the team's 35th in Oakland, California. It was also the 102nd season in franchise history. The Athletics finished first in the American League West with a record of 103-59.

The Athletics' 2002 campaign ranks among the most famous in franchise history. Following the 2001 season, Oakland saw the departure of three key players (the lost boys). Billy Beane, the team's general manager, responded with a series of under-the-radar free agent signings. The new-look Athletics, despite a comparative lack of star power, surprised the baseball world by besting the 2001 team's regular season record. The team is most famous, however, for winning 20 consecutive games between August 13 and September 4, 2002.[1] The Athletics' season was the subject of Michael Lewis' 2003 book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game (as Lewis was given the opportunity to follow the team around throughout that season)

This project is based off the book written by Michael Lewis (later turned into a movie).

In this project we'll work with some data and with the goal of trying to find replacement players for the ones lost at the start of the off-season - During the 2001â€“02 offseason, the team lost three key free agents to larger market teams: 2000 AL MVP Jason Giambi to the New York Yankees, outfielder Johnny Damon to the Boston Red Sox, and closer Jason Isringhausen to the St. Louis Cardinals.

Machine Learning Projects: The data sets used for these several ML models are from Kaggle, UCI Repository or the in-built R data sets. 
All the csv's are provided inside the respective folders.
